## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-cli.git
cd spotify-cli
```

### Build the application

```bash
go build -o spotify-cli
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a Spotify Developer Application

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create an App"
4. Fill in the app name and description
5. Once created, note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
6. Click "Edit Settings" and add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a Redirect URI

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

Replace `your_client_id_here` and `your_client_secret_here` with the values from your Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## Usage

### Run the application

```bash
./spotify-cli
```

On first run, the application will open your browser to authenticate with Spotify. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to the application.

### Available Commands

- `search <query>` - Search for tracks
- `play <number>` - Play track from search results

## Project Structure

## Authentication Flow

The application uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow:

1. On first run, it opens a browser to authenticate with Spotify
2. After successful authentication, Spotify redirects back with an authorization code
3. The application exchanges this code for access and refresh tokens
4. The refresh token is stored in `.refresh_token` for future sessions
5. If the access token expires, it's automatically refreshed
